    * Q&A: Answer questions from attendees on the above
* NumFOCUS mission: Support open scientific computing
    * Want to make sure NF's efforts all center on this mission
* Celebrating milestones and looking forward
    * NF has had considerable impact over the past 12 years
        * See [annual report](https://numfocus.org/community/mission/annual-reports) for full details
    * This motivated NF staff to look at how programs and services can better serve mission and projects
        * Made significant improvements to financial systems in response
        * Added Nolan to focus on business development
        * Nicole has helped get operations in a better place
        * But still more to do in each of these areas
* Growth and impact over past 5 years
    * 160% increase in # of projects
    * 255% increase in project support income
        * "Nearly all income spent in support of projects"
        * S: note that this primarily refers to grant funding raised by the projects; NF charges a fee to administer those funds.
    * 362% increase in internal NF grant funding (Small Development Grants)
        * Getting close to $300000 mark
        * Would like to double that
* Adapting to dynamic growth
    * Growth is not only in scope, but in types of needs as well
    * Need to diversify NF's services to not only meet more projects, but more needs
    * Increase resilience and come up with new funding strategies to address this
* Now going to talk about how NF is going to address these challenges
    * Continue to innovate new funding strategies
    * Develop more financial sustainability
    * Ensure NF's role is continuing to support the community
    * Increase transparency
    * Invest more in infrastructure to support projects
* NF Strategic Vision
    * Strengthen what makes the NF community unique while learning from what has been successful for others
    * Try to put projects first and support them
* Execute on our vision
    * Focus next year will be an investment year and building capacity
    * Looking at what makes NF unique and what should guide our decisions?
    * First and foremost, how does it benefit NF projects?
        * Also have a developer community, donor community and user community
    * Second, make sure it is consistent with NF's values as an org
* Formation of NF OSS Alliance
    * Is a 501\(c)6 arm of NumFOCUS
        * More attractive for many corps to be able to give money to NF projects
    * Current 501\(c)3 will remain as we know it
    * Will allow for a supporting member program
        * Memberships provide access to different corporate budgets than donations
        * Gives members a return on investment for their membership
        * Provides new opportunities for project and supporter cooperation
        * Can be a more renewable funding resource
        * Will also allow a member advisory council to get corporate feedback
* Strengthen community ties
    * Right now have the board of directors and advisory council
        * Board looks at strategic aspects as well as administrative and operational aspects
    * Want to split Board into an administrative board as well as a technical advisory board
        * Administrative board handles legal and administrative matters
        * TAB will provide direct oversight and support to projects and initiatives
    * Election will be different in the past
        * Will give weighted votes to committees, affiliated projects and community organizations
        * Board members will be nominated and reviewed prior to community
        * New volunteer election committee to help manage and guide the process
    * Updated code of conduct
        * Projects completed a questionnaire
        * Will establish a project-driven code of conduct response committee
    * Want to increase involvement in AI alliances
        * NF thinks AI is critical in the future and they haven't been on top of it
* Investing in additional staff
    * First new staff member is going to full time fundraising and finding money for projects
    * Second staff member will focus on shared infrastructure
        * In particular, some kind of shared "build system" (?) for projects
* Current staff status
    * Capacity
        * Staff is currently at max capacity supporting projects
        * Staff has grown a lot, but needs have grown even faster
        * Paused staff expansion over the past year, but restarting it now
    * Ticketing system
        * Moved to a new ticket system but not meeting our needs
        * Key need is providing a message history
        * Also want to have an "AI-supported knowlegebase" for quick answers
    * Communication
        * Want to continue sharing latest updates with projects via NumFOCUS weekly updates
    * Development team expansion
        * Right now just Nolan, haven't been able to "develop" it too much yet
        * Hiring a full time "Fundraising Resource" to work directly with projects on fundraising
        * Will work with projects to collaborate on best funding resources for them
    * Project infrastructure
        * Brought in someone in part time already
        * Infra committee has a PoC for a "Building and Testing Environment"
        * Will be hiring a full time infrastructure person to work on it and other NF infra initiatives
        * Will be posting it soon
* Q&A!
